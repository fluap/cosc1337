# Chapter 7 - 10/16/2023 Lecture Notes
- Header files can be stored in a .h notation
    - Class declarations and prototyping occur in this file.
    - Imported with #include"headerfilename.h"
- cpp files have header implementations for the classes that were prototyped.
    - scope should be included in this file.
    - .cpp

- Both files are then converted to .o (object) and compiled prior to running the .cpp file containing main(){}
- IO should be handled by functions that use classes, not within the class

## Structures in C++
- Requires semicolon;
- its literally a dictionary.
- Attributes must be printed out individually.
- Attributes must be assigned individually.
- can have constructors to assign default values.
    - cant omit datatypes without omitting all subsequent datatypes.
