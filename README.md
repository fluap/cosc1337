- Using github for this kind of work is nefarious and shouldnt reall count towards real contributions.
- Classwork on github for me will serve getting used to the flow of working with github so that its not something I have to pick up on after being ready to do some real work.
- I'm leaving the repo open for other classmates to look at my notes, and assignments, as well as for anyone who has enough time to citicize any early mistakes that can be ironed out before they develop into poor habits.
